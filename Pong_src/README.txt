// This is Pong!
//Authored by me, Preetom Kumar Biswas

// This was one of my projects from undergrad
//You select player mode and difficulty and start playing :)
//For 2 players, the controls are up-arrow and down-arrow (player 2) and 'w' and 's' (player 1)
//Press esc to exit

//for single player mode, there was two ways to give comp paddle an AI update:
// based on reaction time or ball's distance from the comp paddle
//I used reaction time in the game, but it could also be done through reaction distance

//Please disconnect internet connection before opening Pong.exe since it is an unpublished game
//You can reconnect after opening Pong.exe
//Happy playing ;-;
