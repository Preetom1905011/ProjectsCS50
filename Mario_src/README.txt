//This is Alien Mario
// Authored by me, Preetom Kumar Biswas

//This was one of my projects during undergrad

//this is quite similar to the super mario brothers games

//the avatar is controlled by left and right arrow key and space bar(for jumping)
//hit the yellow bricks with the avatar's head to collect coins
//avoid falling into pits and capture the flag at the end before time runs out

//Happy Playing ;-;
