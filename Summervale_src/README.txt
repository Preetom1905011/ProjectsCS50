//This is Summervale
//Authored by me, Preetom Kumar Biswas

//This was one of my projects during undergrad

//the hero is controlled by up and down arrow keys and space bar(for shooting)
//don't let the monsters cross the left border
//you can only afford to let 5 monsters pass
//you need to hit multiple times to kill a monster
//the monsters grow stronger as the levels increase

//Happy Playing ;-;
